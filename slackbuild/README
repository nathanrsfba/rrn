rrn renames files using Perl-style regular expressions. It
is similar to programs such as rename(1), but with more features.

It can perform a wide variety of substitutions, from basic text substitutions,
to substitutions making use of almost any Perl regex syntax, to even using
Perl expressions in substitutions. It includes options to specify case
sensitivity, preserve file extensions, and show changes before they're made.
