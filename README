rrn: Regular expression ReName - v0.9.1 (2009-05-25)
Copyright 2009 by Nathan Roberts <nroberts@tardislabs.com>

rrn is a program that renames files using regular expressions. It is
similar to programs such as 'rename' and 'prename' but with more 
functionality.

rrn is written in Perl, and should run under any system that has Perl
5.8 installed.  Earlier versions may work but have not been tested.

INSTALLATION

Copy rrn.pl to an appropriate bin directory (such as /usr/local/bin),
rename it to 'rrn' (without the .pl) and chmod a+x rrn

Copy rrn.1 to an appropriate man directory (such as /usr/local/man/man1)

Optionally copy other documentation to some appropriate directory

Ideally this should be automated, but I can't figure out the 'accepted' way
to do this

DOCUMENTATION

See the rrn(1) manpage, or the text or HTML versions of same in rrn.txt or
rrn.html, respectively.

LICENSE

rrn is licensed under the GPL.  See the 'LICENSE' file for details.
